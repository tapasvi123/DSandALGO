#  This solution uses regEx to Split the words based on a single white space or multiple ones. Additionally, it uses an if block to pop the characters with extra whitespaces that were missed.

# Lists is used to store the splitted string and manual reversing is done and the string is merged using the join method of strings. 

# New functions learnt but logically this is very poor. Need to try using other languages.
